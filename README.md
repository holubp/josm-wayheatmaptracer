# WayHeatmapTracer

`WayHeatmapTracer` is a JOSM plugin for tracing or realigning selected OSM paths, tracks, and roads against heatmap imagery when the visible activity pattern is clearer than the existing mapped geometry.

The plugin is meant for mappers who already inspect imagery manually, but want help turning a clear heatmap corridor into editable OSM geometry. It samples the rendered heatmap around a selected way, proposes one or more centerline candidates, previews the result, and applies the chosen alignment only after confirmation.

## Why This Exists

Heatmaps are useful in places where normal imagery is ambiguous, outdated, obscured by vegetation, or unavailable. They can reveal:

- the real worn line of a footpath through woods or fields
- the commonly used side of a broad track or service road
- the center of a trail that has drifted away from older GPS traces
- missing paths visible from repeated activity but not from aerial imagery
- places where two paths merge, split, or run close together

Doing this entirely by hand in JOSM is slow: the mapper repeatedly compares the way, the heatmap band, junction constraints, and downloaded-area safety. `WayHeatmapTracer` exists to make that workflow faster while keeping the mapper in control. It does not upload data, does not decide tagging, and does not remove the need to check the result against local knowledge, imagery, GPS traces, and OSM mapping rules.

## When To Use It

Use this plugin when:

- an existing way is close to a clear heatmap corridor and needs geometric alignment
- a path or track is visible in heatmap data but hard to draw accurately by hand
- a long way should be aligned one junction-bounded segment at a time
- a high-traffic road or path has a broad heatmap band and the likely center needs to be inferred
- you want to compare multiple plausible heatmap ridges before applying a move

Prefer ordinary manual editing when:

- the heatmap is weak, sparse, or clearly offset from other trusted sources
- the heatmap may represent private, temporary, forbidden, or non-mappable activity
- the edit would change complex junction topology that you cannot verify
- the surrounding area is not downloaded, unless you intentionally enable the local/no-download drawing option for scratch work

## How It Works

The normal workflow is:

1. Select one OSM way, or select one way plus two nodes to limit the operation to a segment.
2. Choose a heatmap imagery layer, or configure the plugin-managed heatmap layer.
3. Run `Align Way to Heatmap`.
4. Inspect the preview and candidate list.
5. Apply the result only if the proposed geometry is justified by the heatmap and other evidence.

For longer ways, `Select Longest Heatmap Segment` can select the longest section between endpoints or junction nodes, making it easier to work segment by segment without accidentally moving unrelated branches.

The current implementation is designed for private development:
- build a local plugin jar
- install it manually into the JOSM plugin directory on the test machine
- capture diagnostics and logs on the JOSM machine
- move the bundle back to the Codex machine for debugging

## Current Capabilities

- Create or refresh a plugin-managed heatmap TMS layer from user-supplied access values
- Choose Strava activity and color for the managed heatmap layer (`all`, `ride`, `run`, `water`, `winter` and `hot`, `blue`, `bluered`, `purple`, `gray`)
- Optionally interpret the selected heatmap through all supported color classifiers during detection while keeping only the selected color visible; candidates supported by multiple classifiers receive a consensus score boost
- Use palette-specific heatmap evidence: single-color schemes prioritize the brightest coherent core, while dual-color schemes such as `bluered` and `gray` use hue and saturation so high-activity colors outrank lower-activity shoulders
- Track heatmap corridors longitudinally, including short no-signal gaps, so the result is less likely to jump to a nearby parallel trace because of one locally strong sample
- Internally refine ridge detection during one run, reducing the need to run alignment repeatedly to converge
- Treat rough full-way 2-5 node selections as sketch-like input and automatically use precise-shape tracing for them
- Optionally use nearby mapped parallel `highway=*` ways as context when ranking candidates
- Optionally allow alignment in local/no-download layers, bypassing downloaded-area checks for heatmap-only drawing
- Optionally allow junction and endpoint nodes to move with the traced heatmap geometry
- Resolve the heatmap layer by managed layer, exact selected layer title, or regex
- Align one selected way, or one way plus two selected nodes on that way
- Offer two alignment modes:
  `Move Existing Nodes` keeps the node count and only moves non-fixed interior nodes
  `Precise Shape` rebuilds the selected segment from the traced heatmap centerline, reusing existing nodes where possible and adding or removing interior nodes as needed
- Keep segment endpoints fixed
- Treat shared interior nodes as fixed anchors to avoid distorting branching topology
- Select the longest segment of a selected way bounded by endpoints or junction nodes
- Optionally simplify the traced centerline before precise-shape apply; practical tolerances are currently around `0.3` to `1.0`
- Refuse to edit when the selected segment or proposed aligned geometry would extend outside the downloaded JOSM area
- Detect multiple nearby ridge candidates and allow the user to pick one
- Show a preview overlay before applying, including a legend, labeled alternative ridge candidates, and a ridge selector that updates the preview before confirmation
- Export a redacted diagnostics bundle for remote debugging
- Package logs on the JOSM machine with a small bash helper

## Current Limits

- Survey mode is not implemented yet.
- Access values are kept out of docs and diagnostics, but the current plugin stores them in JOSM preferences rather than OS-backed secure storage.
- Heatmap interpretation is strongest for `hot`, `bluered`, and `purple`; `blue` and `gray` are supported but still may need additional tuning in difficult cases.
- Parallel-way awareness is an auxiliary ranking signal. It helps avoid snapping to a neighboring mapped road/path, but the preview still requires mapper review.
- The tracing pipeline still works from the rendered JOSM imagery layer. If future zoom invariance problems remain, the next step would be direct tile sampling at a fixed effective zoom.

## Build

Requirements:
- Java 17+
- Gradle wrapper included (`sh gradlew`)

Build:

```bash
sh gradlew clean build
```

The plugin jar is produced at:

```text
build/libs/wayheatmaptracer-<version>.jar
```

## Private Install Workflow

1. Build the jar on the development machine.
2. Copy the jar to the JOSM machine.
3. Install it into the local JOSM plugins directory.
4. Start JOSM, then open `More tools` and configure the heatmap layer access values.
5. In the settings dialog, enter the exact cookie values named `CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id`, `CloudFront-Policy`, `CloudFront-Signature`, and `_strava_idcf`, or use `Paste cookie header...` to split a copied cookie header into those fields.
6. Select the desired Strava activity and color for the managed layer.
7. Choose either `Move Existing Nodes` or `Precise Shape`. Enable simplification only when testing `Precise Shape`.
8. Use `Select Longest Heatmap Segment` after selecting a way when you want the plugin to choose the longest endpoint/junction-bounded segment before aligning.
9. Test `Align Way to Heatmap`.
10. If the result is wrong, enable `Verbose logging` and `Debug overlay` before rerunning.
11. Export diagnostics from the plugin menu.
12. Run the debug-bundle helper script on the JOSM machine and transfer the resulting archive back.

Helper scripts:
- `scripts/install-private-plugin.sh`
- `scripts/package-debug-bundle.sh`

## Extract Tiles From JOSM Cache

If you cannot provide screenshots directly, you can extract cached TMS tiles from a local JOSM cache directory.

1. Close JOSM first, or copy the cache directory to a temporary folder so the cache files are not being written while you read them.
2. List the available TMS layer prefixes:

```bash
sh gradlew extractJosmTmsCache --args="--cache-dir /path/to/JOSM/cache/tiles --list-prefixes"
```

3. Pick the prefix that matches the heatmap layer title and extract a sample set:

```bash
sh gradlew extractJosmTmsCache --args="--cache-dir /path/to/JOSM/cache/tiles --prefix 'Your Heatmap Layer Title' --out-dir build/extracted-tiles --limit 200"
```

4. Share a small subset of the extracted image tiles, not the raw cache database files.

The extractor reads JOSM's current `TMS_BLOCK_v2.key` and `TMS_BLOCK_v2.data` cache format directly.

## Security and Documentation Rules

- Raw tokenized URLs are not shown in docs or example commands.
- Short-lived access values must be treated as secrets.
- Diagnostics exports are redacted by default.
- The plugin name is neutral and does not use third-party product branding.

## Strava Heatmap Support

The plugin explicitly supports a Strava heatmap imagery workflow for OSM improvement, but the plugin itself is branded as `WayHeatmapTracer`.

The documentation avoids publishing a raw tokenized imagery URL, but the settings dialog uses the real cookie field names so users can copy the values accurately.
